# odin-recipes
Recipes project from the Foundations course of The Odin Project. It can be accessed on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

The assignment is to create a recipes website, with a homepage that links to the recipes. A recipe must have a title, an image, a list of ingredients and a list of steps to prepare the recipe.

My goal is to practice some basic html, setup different linked pages and work with git using terminal commands.
