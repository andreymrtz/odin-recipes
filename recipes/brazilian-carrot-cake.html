        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, water, and butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to bubble and thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly spread while hot over cake.</li>
