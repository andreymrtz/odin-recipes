    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cocada is a popular street food sold everywhere in Brazil. It's a sweet made with grated fresh coconut. There are many variations, you can try adding any flavoring that you like!.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups grated fresh coconut, about 500 grams</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, add water and sugar, mix lightly. Heat over medium heat, without stirring, until the sugar syrup forms a thread when lifted and dropped by a spoon, about 20 minutes. Brush the sides of the pan with water if any sugar crystals are formed.</li>
        <li>Add grated coconut, mix just enough to coat every thread of coconut with sugar syrup. Cook without stirring for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cocada with the syrup to a bowl, let rest for 5 minutes. Grease a sheet pan with butter or line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Using spoons, shape the cocadas while hot and humid as you like. You can grab some amount with the spoon and drop it like a mound, shape it using the spoons like a quenelle, etc.</li>
        <li>Let the cocadas dry out at room temperature, for about one hour. They form a crunchy shell on the outside and are still tender inside.</li>
    </ol>
