    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It has a wonderful, creamy texture without being too heavy, made with sweet condensed milk. Melted syrup will run down sides, forming a caramel sauce. Serve cool with a dollop of whipped cream on the side. Top it with toasted coconut and serve with a garnish of tropical fruits such as mango or pineapple.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar for the caramel sauce</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt the sugar in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Once the sugar becomes a golden brown syrup after about 10 minutes, pour it immediately into a round baking dish, swirling so that the syrup coats all sides of the dish. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs just until mixed. Add condensed milk and milk and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture into a metal baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Place baking dish a roasting pan, place it on oven rack. Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. The center of the flan should still be soft. Allow flan to cool before putting the baking dish on the fridge. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Unmold the flan onto a dish and serve. You can heat the bottom of the baking dish on the stove to help to loose the hardened caramel syrup.</li>
    </ol>
